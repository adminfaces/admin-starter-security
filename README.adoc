== Authentication

The application has two users configured via `Custom IdentityStore`, https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-starter-security/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/adminfaces/starter/infra/security/CustomInMemoryIdentityStore.java[see here^].

.email/password
* admin@faces.com/admin 
* user@faces.com/user

`admin@faces.com` user has role `admin`.

`user@faces.com` user has role `user`.

== Authorization

Admin user with `role admin` can access any page while `role user` can access only pages under `/pages` path (only car-list page). See https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-starter-security/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml#L12[url security constraints^].

Users without access to restricted pages (car-form) will be redirected to `Access Denied` page:

.AccessDenied

Admin have permissions for all CRUD operations on top of Car entity while common user can only view/list cars.

At page level buttons (like delete) are disabled using following EL:

----

disabled="#{not externalContext.isUserInRole('ADMIN')"
----


At method level `@RolesAllowed("ADMIN")` annotation is used.

TIP: Try using uncommenting finById rolesAllowed on https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-starter-security/blob/58edd484581722cdb7063879c0fac444fe89e7ff/src/main/java/com/github/adminfaces/starter/service/CarService.java#L181[carService here^] and use `find by ID` on car-list page with non admin user, it should redirect to Access Denied page.
